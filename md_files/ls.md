# ls

### It returns the contents of the directory.

On running this command
```bash
pratham@Pratham-Inspiron:~/linux-cmds$ ls
```
I get the following output
```bash
README.md  cat.md  cd.md  chmod.md  cp.md  diff.md  grep.md  head.md  ls.md  mkdir.md  mv.md  operator.md  pwd.md  rm.md  rmdir.md  scp.md  tail.md  tar.md  wc.md
```

Here the command `ls` takes the current working directory as the default argument.
